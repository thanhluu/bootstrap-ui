Bootstrap UI uses [http://gruntjs.com/](Grunt) for its build system, with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more.

To install Grunt, you must **first [download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)** (which includes npm). npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root `/bootstrap-ui/` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the `package.json` file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there. It will also automatically run `bower install`, which install packages defined in `bower.json`.
3. When completed, you'll be able to run `grunt watch` command provided from the command line.

Editor preferences are available in the [editor config](https://github.com/thanhluu/bootstrap-ui/blob/gh-pages/.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at [http://editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org).
